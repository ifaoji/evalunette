# Evalunette

Evalunette is yet another tester for 42 projects. I developed it for my
evaluations, allowing me to prioritize code quality over manual testing.

**DO NOT** rely on this tester to verify the functionality of your code. Using
it as a crutch hinders your learning process. Mastery in coding comes with an
understanding of how to test your code effectively. Relying solely on automated
testers prevents you from developing the skills necessary to write high-quality
code; instead, you'll only learn how to meet the requirements of these testers.

Designed with evaluations in mind, Evalunette aims for simplicity and minimalism
in its requirements. This means the codebase does not take usage of third-party
dependencies. It utilizes only Python, its standard library, and a selection of
shell commands.
